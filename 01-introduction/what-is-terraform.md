# What is Terraform?

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define,
provision, and manage cloud and on-prem infrastructure using code instead of
manual console operations.

Terraform uses configuration files to describe the desired state of infrastructure,
and it automatically handles resource dependencies and creation order.
