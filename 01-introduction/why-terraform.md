# Why Terraform?

Terraform is widely used because it provides:

- Consistent and repeatable infrastructure provisioning
- Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud support
- Safe execution using plan-before-apply
- Automatic dependency management
- Time and cost efficiency in large environments

## Vendor Lock-in Explained

Vendor lock-in means being tightly dependent on a single cloud provider.
Terraform helps avoid this by:

- Supporting multiple cloud providers
- Allowing easier migration between clouds
- Enabling multi-cloud and hybrid deployments using a single tool
